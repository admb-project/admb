ADMB-12.2
---------

*Released July 31, 2020*  

#### New Supported Compilers
* GNU C++ 10 

#### New Features

* New user compilation option `-p` to build a portable (statically linked) model
  executable, which runs independently of underlying system libraries. For
  example, if one Linux machine has system library GLIBC 2.29 and another has
  GLIBC 2.28, users can now compile with

  ```
  admb -p simple
  ```

  to produce an executable that can run on both machines.  [See Issue #127](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/127)

* Added access functions for ln_det, hessian and hessian inverse which should only be used in the FINAL_SECTION. [See Issue #132](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/132)

  ```
  FINAL_SECTION
  cout << "\nln_det:\n" << get_ln_det_value() << endl;
  cout << "\nhessian:\n" << get_hessian() << endl;
  cout << "\nhessian inverse:\n" << get_hessian_inverse() << endl;
  ```

* Added code to do mass matrix adaptation in the NUTS routine.
  This can be initiated with the flag
  `-adapt_mass_dense` when calling the NUTS routine with
  `-nuts`. It is an experimental feature.
  
#### Changes and Improvements

* Fixed GNUmakefile and admb script when building for MacOS and clang.  [See Issue #128](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/128)
* Function sqr should compute the square of a variable not the square root.  [See Issue #129](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/129)
* Add batch file create-admb-command-prompt.bat to create shortcut with full instead of relative path.  [See Issue #135](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/135)
* Able to use FINAL_SECTION without REPORT_SECTION. [See Issue #133](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/133)
* Fixed core dump when deallocating already freed memory from xpools.  [See Issue #138](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/138)   
  *Note: USE_VECTOR_SHAPE_POOL for memory pool is now disabled by default.*   
* Support adstring_array in DATA_SECTION.  [See Issue #143](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/143)
* Merged adnuts improvements developed by @Cole-Monnahan-NOAA.  [See Pull #146](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/pull/146)
  - Several bugs in the NUTS MCMC routine were fixed, adaptation schemes altered, and console output improved.
  - Validity testing of all MCMC algorithms against known statistical distributions give strong evidence of the robustness of them.  
* Applied fixes from @yukio-takeuchi.
  * [Issue #122](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/122)
  * [Issue #125](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/125)
  * [Issue #126](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/126)
  * [Issue #120](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/120)
* Fixed Windows build issue reported by Jon Schnute.  [See Issue #130](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/issues/130)
* Added api documentation for functions.
* Fixed windows admb building with invalid /32 character. [See commit](https://github.com/admb-project/admb/commit/7bf1f308cad12c9c2fda0fa9dc844768691b156d) 
* Windows Innosetup installer includes mingw-w64 compiler used in Rtools 4.0.
* Updated make.exe and sed.exe in utilities from Rtools 4.0.
* Improvements to GNUmakefile files to build with GNU Make 4.3.

ADMB-12.0
---------

*Released December 21, 2017*  

#### New Supported Compilers

* GNU C++ 7
* Intel C++ Compiler 2018
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC++ 14.1)

  __Note__ Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 is no longer supported.

#### New Feature

* Dr. Cole Monnahan has developed a new MCMC functionality into ADMB. The
  current Metropolis algorithm was updated to have more meaningful console
  output and not require an sdreport object. The old method remains, and
  the new one is accessible with argument '-rwm'. A new algorithm, the
  no-U-turn sampler (a self-tuning extension of the existing 'hybrid'
  method was also added, and available with '-nuts'. The functionality
  matches the software platform Stan closely. The user can specify whether
  to use the MLE covariance, an arbitrary matrix, or adapt one during the
  warmup phase (recommended). Both these additions work much with the R
  package adnuts, which streamlines workflow, including parallel chains,
  diagnostic checking, and inference. See adnuts package vignette for more
  information.

#### Changes and Improvements

There were approximately 900 commits to improve ADMB.
Below are some of the changes.

* Fixed many signed and unsigned conversion warnings.
* Reverted change to gradcalc wrapper which caused incorrect outputs in profiler (see https://github.com/admb-project/admb/commit/6ffe1a00cc308dec52a271fa0cc088bfadfe6061).
* Fixed 2gb limitation for file i/o using MSVC compiler.
* Improved and simplified DF_FILE functions.
* Added and updated function documentation.
* Increased testing code coverage.
* Updated tiny_ad.
* Fixed issue #86.  Increased max initial parameters from 250 to 4000.

---------

#### New Supported Compilers

* GNU C++ 6.2 and 5.3
* Rtools 3.4
* Oracle Developer Studio 12.5
* Intel C++ Compiler 2017

#### Changes and Improvements

* Added floating point checking into tpl2cpp and tpl2rem.

  To check for floating point errors, build executable with -g option.

  ```

  Run executable with debugger (such as gdb) to locate file and line number
  where error occured.

  ```
  $ gdb ./model
  ```

* Configured and automated builds for ADMB-IDE.
* Merged Kasper Kristensen and Anders Nielsen bug fixes.
* Added new features such as tiny_ad.hpp and vectorize developed by DTU. See the report [Extending TMB and ADMB functionality jointly](http://www.admb-project.org/developers/workshops/seattle-2016/Kristensen_Anders_Report.pdf).

* admb scripts can determine which parser (tpl2cpp or tpl2rem) to use.

  ```
  [~/admb/examples/admb-re/union/]$ ~/admb/admb union
  ```

  _Note: Option *-r* is no longer needed to build the random effects model._

  ```

* Add shared target to build files (Unix only).

  ```
  $ make shared
  ```

* admb scripts can be called directly and do not require setting enviromental variables
  ADMB_HOME and PATH.

    For Unix,  
   
        [~/admb/example/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb simple

    For Windows, 
  
        C:\admb\example\admb\simple\> C:\admb\admb simple

        [~/admb/example/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb simple.tpl mysource.cpp

    For Windows, 
  
        C:\admb\example\admb\simple\> C:\admb\admb simple.tpl mysource.cpp

* admb scripts have a new option -f for optimized library "OPT_LIB".

    For Unix, 
  
        [~/admb/example/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb -f simple.tpl mysource.cpp

    For Windows, 
  
        C:\admb\example\admb\simple\> C:\admb\admb -f simple.tpl mysource.cpp

* admb scripts have a new option -c for only building object files.

    Both commands below will only build simple.o and mysource.o compiled object files.  
    The model application will not be built. 

    For Unix, 
      
        [~/admb/example/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb -c simple.tpl mysource.cpp

---------

*ADMB-11.1*  
*Released May 10, 2013*  

#### Changes

* Updated Visual Studio nmake build files.

* Improved Unix build files.
 
  * Only outdated files are rebuilt.
  * Fast parallel building with source distribution
        
        [~/admb/]$ make -j
        
  * Building from source will create distribution folder in 'build/dist' instead of 'build/os-compiler-arch'.

* Combined mulitple libraries to a single library 'libadmb.a'. 

* Reverted some algorithms to previous version-9 code.

* The compilation scripts (adcomp, adlink, admb) compile in "safe" mode by 
  default.

  and tpl2rem.lex files.
  
* Improved documentation.

#### New Features
* admb script can now build tpl models without the need to set ADMB_HOME
  or PATH. For example, 

        [~/admb-11.1/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb-11.1/admb simple

* Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
  directory 'contrib'. Read 'contrib/README.txt'.

* New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

* New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
  equivalent to norm2().

* New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
