Overview
--------
The ADMB (Automatic Differentiation Model Builder) software suite is an
environment for nonlinear statistical modeling enabling rapid model
development, numerical stability, fast and efficient computation, and high
accuracy parameter estimates. AD Model Builder is a high level language built
around the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension which transparently
implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. A closely related software
package, ADMB-RE, implements random effects in nonlinear models.

ADMB is an open source project.  Read the AD Model Builder [LICENSE][LICENSE_link].
