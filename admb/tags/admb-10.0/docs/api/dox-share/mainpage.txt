Documentation of mathematical functions can be found on the "Modules" tab.

<br>
Partial documentation of some of the AUTODIF Library and ADMB classes can
found on the "Classes" tab. No class is 
fully documented. See class \ref dvector for an example of 
how it might look and how to insert documentation.

This preliminary version of the API documentation is a work in progress.

/**  \defgroup matop Vector and Matrix Operations. 
\details The syntax of ADMB Matrix and vector operations follows normal
mathematical conventions as much as possible. If \c u and \c v are
vectors and \c M is a matrix, \code u*M \endcode is a normal matrix
multiplication and \code u*v \endcode is a dot product. 
Element-wise multiplications and divisions are accomplished by
\ref elem_prod and \ref elem_div respectively. 
If the arguments to these operations are not conformable for the appropriate
type and operation, the application will exit with an error message.

These operations have been overloaded for appropriate combinations of
constant and variable objects. 
The overloaded versions with variable
types are optimized for efficient derivative computation. 
Only the constant types are currently documented here.
