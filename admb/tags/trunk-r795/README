Overview
--------
The ADMB software suite is an environment for non-linear statistical
modeling enabling rapid model development, numerical stability, fast
and efficient computation, and high accuracy parameter estimates.
ADModel Builder is a high level language built around the AUTODIF
Library, a C++ language extension which transparently implements
reverse mode automatic differentiation. A closely related software
package, ADMB-RE, implements random effects in non-linear models.

Building from source
====================

Using MinGW shell
-----------------
Prerequistes:
* Downloaded and installed Mingw using "Automated MinGW Installer"

Procedure:
1. Open MinGW shell in Start->All Programs->MinGW->MinGW Shell. 

2. Download and extract the ADMB src distribution.


3. Enter the command below to create the configure script.

   $ make --directory=scripts/configure

4. Enter the command below to use the configure scripts to create the GNUMakefile.

   $ ./configure

5. Build binaries

   $ make

6. [Optional] Test build 

   $ make verify

7. Install

   $ make install

Installs a script("/usr/local/bin/admb") and the library folder("/usr/local/admb").
