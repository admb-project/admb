ADMB Project
Version 10.0 Beta
Released November 1, 2010

Overview
========
The ADMB(Automatic Differentiation Model Builder) software suite 
is an environment for non-linear statistical modeling enabling rapid 
model development, numerical stability, fast and efficient computation, 
and high accuracy parameter estimates.  ADModel Builder is a high level 
language built around the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension 
which transparently implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. 
A closely related software package, ADMB-RE, implements random effects 
in non-linear models.

Donations
=========
ADMB is an open source project that is freely available for download.
If you would like to contribute or donate funds, please contact 
<users@admb-project.org>.  Cool ADMB T-shirts are also available for 
purchase.

Release Notes
=============
The goal for this release was to improve algorithms, add new requested
feeatures, correct defects (bugs), and streamline installation and build
process.

Below lists some of the changes.

Changes
-------
 * Improved algorithms
 * Matrix exponential
 * Hybrid MCMC
 * Sparse Hessian
 * Added more examples
 * Added support for Intel C++ compiler
 * Added Autoconf script
 * Various bug fixes and improvements 

Requirements
============
ADMB has been tested and used on Windows and UNIX operating systems 
in both 32 and 64 bit versions.  A C/C++ compiler is required to 
installed on the local computer. Below lists some tested compilers.

Several compilers are supported including 
 * GNU g++ 3.4 or newer
 * Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or newer
 * Borland 5.5
 * MacOS XCode 3.2
 * Intel C++ Compiler 11

If the compiler is not listed, build the source distribution or 
email user help <users@admb-project.org>.

Downloading
===========
Precompiled binaries and the source distribution can be downloaded
from "http://www.admb-project.org/downloads/".

============

From Source Code
----------------
Building form source code installation instructions can be found at 
"http://www.admb-project.org/documention/".

Unix and GNU g++
1. Configure the build files

   $ ./configure

2. Build libraries 
  
   $ make

3. [Optional] Test build by running examples

   $ make verify

4. Install libraries to default location /usr/local.

   $ make install

Microsoft Windows and Visual C++

1. Extract source distribution.

2. Open Visual C++ Command Prompt. 

3. Change directory to the "src" folder. 

   > cd admb-10.0-src\src

4. Build libraries

   > nmake /fvc.mak

5. [Optional] Test build by running examples

   > nmake /fvc.mak verify

6. Install libraries to default location %ProgramFiles%\ADMB
   and adds ADMB shortcuts in the Start menu.

   > nmake /fvc.mak install
