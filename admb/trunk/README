Overview
--------
The ADMB software suite is an environment for non-linear statistical
modeling enabling rapid model development, numerical stability, fast
and efficient computation, and high accuracy parameter estimates.
ADModel Builder is a high level language built around the AUTODIF
Library, a C++ language extension which transparently implements
reverse mode automatic differentiation. A closely related software
package, ADMB-RE, implements random effects in non-linear models.
