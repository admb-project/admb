/**  \defgroup matop Vector and Matrix Operations. 
\details The syntax of ADMB Matrix and vector operations follows normal
mathematical conventions as much as possible. If \c u and \c v are
vectors and \c M is a matrix, \code u*M \endcode is a normal matrix
multiplication and \code u*v \endcode is a dot product. 

Element-wise multiplications and divisions are accomplished by
\ref elem_prod and \ref elem_div respectively. 
Both functions return a vector.

/**  \defgroup misc "Helper" Functions

typically optimized for automatic differentiation and automatically
invoke custom adjoint code.
