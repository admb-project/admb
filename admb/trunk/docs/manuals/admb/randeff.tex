The random effects module is sold as a separate ``add on"
for ADMB.
At present the documentation for the random effects module is
contained in a separate document.
\X{random effects module}
\mysection{Using the random effects module -- advice for current
ADMB users}

The main differences you will find with the random effects module are
that it is much more computationally intensive than the 
ADMB code especially when you have a large number of random effects.
Also many of the current functions you find in ADMB have not yet been ported to this module. If you find something that you want is missing let us know 
and we will try to supply it.
