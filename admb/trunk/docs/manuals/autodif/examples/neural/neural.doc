      To run the neural net example complete the following steps:

      1. Compile and link winit.exe neur1.exe and nplot2.exe

      2. Run winit.exe to generate initial estimates for the weight  and
      bias terms. This program reads the file STRUCT.NRL and generates a
      set of random values for the weight and bias terms.  These  values
      will be placed in the file WEIGHTS.PAR.

      3.  Run  neur1.exe to train the neural net using the points in the
      file LEARNING.SMP which constitute the spirals  shown  the  figure
      4.1. It may take many hours (more than 20) to completely train the
      net. You can  interrupt  the  training  by  pressing  `Q'  on  the
      keyboard   and  the  current  weights will be saved in EST.PAR. To
      resume  training,  copy  EST.PAR  to   WEIGHTS.PAR   and   restart
      neur1.exe.

      4. If you have and EGA or VGA display, you can see a color plot of
      the  results   by  running  nplot2.exe.  This  program  must  read
      LEARNING.SMP,  WEIGHTS.PAR  and  STRUCT.NRL.  Red,  green  or blue
      points are plotted of the net considers that  point   to   be   on
      one   of   the spirals.  Gray  points  are plotted for points that
      the net cannot classify. The classification rule depends  on   the
      values   of  the nodes in the output layer. If one of the nodes is
      positive and the other 2 negative the point is  considered  to  be
      "on"   the   spiral. You  can  experiment  with the classification
      rule by changing the procedure select_color(...).

      To view the classification produced by a "well trained" nerual net,
      copy  the  file  WEIGHTS.PA1   to  WEIGHTS.PAR  prior  to  running 
      nplot2.exe.
