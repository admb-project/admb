AD Model Builder provides the user with a template like approach 
for the rapid development and prototyping of nonlinear statistical 
models. While the power of automatic differentiation techniques for
use in nonlinear optimization is now well established, to easily
exploit this power in writing code for nonlinear statistical models 
requires the user to interface with an optimization procedure and
to carry out a number of diagnostic procedures on the results of
the parameter estimation such as profile likelihood calculations,
Markov chain Monte Carlo calcuations, or simply delta method 
estimates of standard deviations. The AD Model Builder package
has abstracted these interfaces so that their implementation 
becomes automatic. The user need only specify the parts of the model
unique to the specific situation. Operations on high level data
structures are supported. The code produced is very fast and
either standalone applications or DLL's (shared libraries) which can 
be called from slower packages such as SPLUS or GAUSS can be 
produced. The software has hundreds of users world wide in 
applciations from natural resource modeling to financial engineering.
