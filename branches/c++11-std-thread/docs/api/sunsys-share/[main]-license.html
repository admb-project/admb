A simple scrambling/descrambling of email addresses is available to help
avoiding the ever annoying spam-bots:

	<a href="#" onClick="javascript:emailScramble('mailto:name@domain.com');">scramble</a>

then replace the INSERT_SCRAMBLED_EMAIL text with copy & paste of the result:

	<a href="javascript:emailDescramble('INSERT_SCRAMBLED_EMAIL');">descramble</a>
