_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Extract random effects from objects fitted with the function
     'glmm.admb'  and (optionally) their standard deviations.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ranef.glmm.admb(object, sd = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: An object (a fit) returned from 'glmm.admb'

      sd: logical.  If 'TRUE', the standard deviations of the random
          effects are returned, rather than point estimates.

     ...: Further arguments passed on

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The point estimates of the random effects are 'empirical Bayes'
     estimates in the sense that the hyperparameters (fixed effects,
     variance components etc) are fixed at their MLE's when the joint
     likelihood is maximized with respect to the random effects.
     However, uncertainty about the hyperparameters is taken into
     account when the  standard deviations of the random effects are
     calculated.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix of estimated random effects (or standard deviations).
