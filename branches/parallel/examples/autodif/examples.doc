      The AUTODIF  distribution  disk  includes  many  of  the  examples
      discussed  in  the  User's  Guide. The examples are contained in a
      self-extracting executable archive named EXAMPLES.EXE The  install
      program  will  extract  this archive into the directory specified.


      Compiling the examples with make
      --------------------------------

      If your are familiar with the make utility, the  simplest  way  to
      compile  the  examples  is to simply type 'make all' at the system
      prompt. See comments on makefile below.


      Compiling the examples with Borland C++
      ---------------------------------------

      If you are using the Borland compiler, you can use  the  'project'
      files  to get a better idea of what is going on. Start the borland
      compiler and open a project file by pressing <Alt><P> then <O>.  A
      list  of  files  to  be compiled and linked (including the AUTODIF
      library) will appear in a window near the bottom  of  the  screen.
      The  default  library is AUTDIF7.LIB. If you do not have a numeric
      coprocessor, change the library specified to AUTDIFE.LIB.

      It may be  necessary  to  change  the  paths  where  the  compiler
      searches  for the include files and libraries. Press <Alt><O> then
      <D> and enter the information in the include  and  library  fields
      displayed.

      Approximately 2.8Mb of disk space is  required to compile and link
      all of the examples with 'make all'.


      The following files will be created
      -----------------------------------

      makefile - Make file to compile  and  link  the  examples.  It  is
      necessary  to  modify  the  makefile to match the configuration of
      your computer system. The definitions of the macros INCLUDE,  LIB,
      CFLAGS, CC , and LL will usually require modification. Type  "make
      all" to make all of the examples. To make a single  example,  type
      "make  NAME.exe"  where  NAME is the name of the following example
      executables:  simple.exe,  hemholtz.exe,  minimize.exe,  newt.exe,
      io_examp.exe,   mixture.exe,  normsim.exe,  neur1.exe,  winit.exe,
      nplot2.exe, robust.exe robsim.exe
