@chapter Preamble

@section Credit

AD Model Builder (ADMB) was written by David Fournier at Otter Research in
Canada, and Template Model Builder (TMB) was written by Kasper Kristensen at DTU
Aqua in Denmark.

@section Simplified Emacs

The main purpose of AD Studio is to make the convenient Emacs features of
@command{admb-mode} and @command{tmb-mode} available to non-Emacs users. In
other words, to disable the standard Emacs behavior.

@cartouche
@noindent
Experienced Emacs users may prefer to ignore the AD Studio @file{.emacs} file,
and simply install and load ADMB Mode (@file{admb.el}) and TMB Mode
(@file{tmb.el}) like other Emacs packages. They are written as standard ``major
modes'' that follow all Emacs mode conventions.
@end cartouche

@section History and name

AD Studio is the unification of two previous software products, ADMB-IDE
(Magnusson 2009) and TMB-IDE (Magnusson 2015). The `AD' stands for automatic
differentiation and `Studio' is a commonly used synonym for IDE (integrated
development environment).

@chapter AD Studio overview

@section Statistical modelling

Developing statistical models in ADMB and TMB is an iterative process that
consists of writing, compiling, testing, and debugging. AD Studio has been
designed specifically to allow the user to perform these tasks more efficiently
than in other working environments. For example, TMB model development involves
working on C++ and R code side by side on the screen, but in some editors, such
as RStudio, it is not possible to view two source code files at the same time.

GNU Emacs is a complex and powerful editor that comes with particularly good
support for C++, R, @LaTeX, backup/version control, and other useful features
for statistical computing. The dedicated ADMB and TMB modes provide syntax
highlighting, compilation, file manipulation, outline code navigation,
templates, and smaller tools for developing models. Emacs users can download
@file{admb-mode.el} and @file{tmb-mode.el} and start using them right away,
after reading the commentary at the top of these files.

The problem with Emacs is that it requires considerable time to learn and
configure, although for advanced statistical computing this can be a rewarding
investment. As the programmer Larry Wall once said: ``If ease of use was the
highest goal, we'd all be driving golf carts.'' The
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs} page contains some pointers
for setting up and learning Emacs. There are, however, good reasons why many
users may not feel like adopting Emacs as their main editor, but would still
appreciate a dedicated environment for ADMB and TMB.

The rest of this tutorial demonstrates how AD Studio can used without learning
the details of Emacs. This is achieved with an unusual @file{.emacs}
configuration file that emulates common keybindings of basic editors, while
disabling some of the most used Emacs keybindings. This @file{.emacs} file is
therefore not intended for experienced Emacs users, although they may find it an
interesting read.

@section Software components

AD Model Builder (@strong{ADMB}) and Template Model Builder (@strong{TMB}) are
software platforms that utilize automatic differentiation (AD) and Laplace
approximation to estimate parameters and random effects in a fast and reliable
way. ADMB and TMB generally give the same model fit, but they offer different
features. ADMB is a stand-alone application that tends to have better MCMC
functionality, while TMB is an R package that has more convenient and faster
estimation of random effects.

The @strong{Emacs} editor has dedicated modes for editing different file types
and for other tasks. In addition to standard Emacs features, AD Studio includes
modes to work with ADMB, @LaTeX, Markdown, R, and TMB.

The @strong{GCC} C++ compiler and @strong{GDB} debugger are provided by Rtools.
By using the same compiler to build ADMB and TMB models, AD Studio makes it easy
to work with ADMB and TMB on the same machine without running into compiler
version conflicts.

@section Installation

AD Studio consists of components that can be set up individually by hand
(Windows, Linux, Mac) or using an installer (Windows).

@subsec Installer

@noindent
The Windows installer @file{@value{INSTALLER}.exe} sets up ADMB, GCC, GDB,
Emacs, and the Emacs packages, along with file associations and environment
variables to glue everything together. Users are expected to install R and TMB
on their own, as these are frequently updated.

@sp
@center @image{intro-install,9cm}

@noindent
Once installed, the software components reside in four different root directories:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .35
@item Directory        @tab Component
@item @code{c:/~}      @tab Emacs packages and settings
@item @code{c:/admb}   @tab ADMB
@item @code{c:/gnu}    @tab Emacs
@item @code{c:/Rtools} @tab Rtools
@end multitable

@noindent
This directory structure can be practical for setting up other free statistical
software, such as R. By separating the main program (@code{c:/gnu/r}) from the
user settings (@code{c:/~/.Rprofile, c:/~/Rconsole}) and user libraries
(@code{c:/~/r/library}), the main program can be removed and upgraded without
affecting the user setup.

One thing to keep in mind is that the installer modifies the user @env{PATH} and
file associations. In rare cases, users may need to reconfigure these according
to taste and needs after installing AD Studio. Advanced users may choose to
deselect these options during the installation for this reason.

@subsec Manual setup

@noindent
Windows users can also set up and configure ADMB, Emacs, and Rtools by hand,
starting from the @file{@value{INSTALLER}.zip} kit. The following guidelines may
be useful for that:

@uref{http://admb-project.org/docs}

@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs/install}

@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs/configure}

@uref{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}

@sp 0.5

@noindent
See also the chapters on @ref{Configuration} and @ref{Troubleshooting} in this
manual.

@page

@subsec AD Studio Linux/Mac

@noindent
Setting up AD Studio for Linux or Mac is equivalent to the ``manual setup''
described above, so the same guidelines apply. The key steps are:

@enumerate
@item Install ADMB, GNU Emacs, GCC (including the C++ component), and GDB.

@item Download the AD Studio
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/adstudio/core,@file{.emacs}} configuration
file and place it in @file{~/.emacs} to apply the simplified Emacs user
interface.

@item Download Emacs packages and place inside @code{~/emacs/lisp} to
provide mode-specific syntax highlighting and commands.
@end enumerate

@noindent
The screenshots in the next chapter are from Windows, but AD Studio looks very
similar in Linux:

@screen{intro-linux}

@chapter ADMB tutorial

@section Create a working copy of @command{simple}

First open Windows Explorer and create a folder called @code{c:/simple}. Then
navigate to @code{c:/admb/@value{ADMBDIR}/examples/admb/simple} and copy the
model and data files, creating:

@example
c:/simple/simple.dat
c:/simple/simple.tpl
@end example

Now double-click @file{simple.tpl} in the @code{c:/simple} folder. The file
should open in Emacs in @command{admb-mode} (see red circle) and the code should
be in color:

@screen{tutor-open-circle}

@page

@section Build, run, and view the results

Build the model by clicking the @icon{icon-connect} icon, or press @key{f8}:

@screen{tutor-build-circle}

@page

@noindent
Run the model by clicking the @icon{icon-jump-to} icon, or press @key{f9}:

@screen{tutor-run-circle}

Many ADMB models output their results to a @file{.rep} report file, and AD
Studio provides the @icon{icon-describe} icon and @key{f10} key to open the
report file. The @command{simple} model outputs no report file, but the
parameter estimates, standard errors, and correlations are found in the
@file{.cor} file.

This is an opportunity to introduce basic buffer and window management. In
Emacs, a buffer is like a page, often representing a file, but sometimes other
things, like compilation and command output. The Emacs screen is divided into
one or more windows, where each window shows one buffer, while other buffers
reside in the background. Explore the @clickthis{Buffers} menu, as well as
buffer-related @ref{Keybindings}. A window can be split in two by selecting
@clickthis{New Window Below} (@kbd{C-x 2}) or @clickthis{New Window on Right}
(@kbd{C-x 3}) in the @clickthis{File} menu. The @key{escape} key lets one window
fill the Emacs screen.

Try out different ways to open the @file{.cor} file:

@enumerate
@item Press @key{escape} to maximize the active window. Then click the
@icon{icon-open} icon or press @kbd{C-o} (@key{Ctrl} and @key{o}) and select
@code{c:/simple/simple.cor}.
@item Press @key{escape} to maximize the active window, @kbd{C-x 3} to split
into two windows, and select the window on the right with a mouse click or
@key{f6}. Click the @icon{icon-open} icon or press @kbd{C-o} and select
@code{c:/simple/simple.cor}.
@item Click the @clickthis{ADMB @click{} View Estimates} menu entry or press
@kbd{S-f10}.
@item Click the @clickthis{ADMB @click{} View Any} menu entry or press
@kbd{C-p}, then type @samp{cor} and @key{return}.
@end enumerate

@page

@screen{tutor-cor}

After viewing, maximize a window by pressing @key{escape}, or close a window by
clicking the @icon{icon-close} icon or pressing @kbd{C-w} or @kbd{C-f4}.

@cartouche
@noindent
Note how the ADMB menu and toolbar icons are only available when the active
window is in @command{admb-mode}. Press @key{f2} at any point to switch a window
to @command{admb-mode}.
@end cartouche

@page

@section Debug

@b{Types of bugs}
@anchor{Types of bugs}

@noindent
Bugs in ADMB models can be categorized by the point of discovery:

@enumerate
@item @command{tpl2cpp} reports a bug (cannot translate)
@item @command{g++} reports a bug (cannot compile or link)
@item The model builds fine, but crashes or writes no output when run (no
results)
@item The model runs fine, but not like it is supposed to (strange results)
@end enumerate

@subsec Locating bugs

@itemize
@item Warnings or error messages indicate line number, or function/variable name
@item Insert lines of code that print informative messages during runtime
@item Comment out parts of the code
@item Use a debugger
@end itemize

@subsec Example 1: @command{tpl2cpp} reports a bug

@noindent
Create a bug by inserting an extra space inside a vector declaration:
@code{init_vector Y(1,nobs)} @arrow{} @code{init_vector Y(1, nobs)}. Then click
the @icon{icon-disconnect} icon or press @key{f7} to translate TPL to C++:

@screen{bug-tpl}

The @command{tpl2cpp} translator reports an error in line 36 of
@file{simple.tpl}. Click @clickthis{Edit @click{} Go To @click{} Goto Line} or
press @kbd{C-g} to move the cursor to that line, and then remove the unwanted
space.

@page

@subsec Example 2: @command{g++} reports a bug

@noindent
Create a bug by referring to a nonexistent variable: @code{init_vector
Y(1,nobs)} @arrow{} @code{init_vector Y(1,n)}. Then click the
@icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8} to build the model:

@screen{bug-gcc}

The @command{g++} compiler reports an error in line 11 of @file{simple.cpp}.
Click the highlighted filename to open the C++ source file with the cursor in
that line. After realizing what the problem is (with the help of the error
message @t{@i{`n' was not declared in this scope}}), go back to the ADMB code in
@file{simple.tpl} and change the @samp{n} to @samp{nobs}.

@page

@subsec Example 3: No results

@noindent
Create a bug by dividing by zero at the top of the @code{DATA_SECTION}: @code{!!
cout << 1/0 << endl;}. Then click the @icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8}
to build the model. Ignoring the warning, click @icon{icon-jump-to} or press
@key{f9} to run the model:

@screen{bug-nothing}

@sp 0.5

The shell command @command{simple} exits abnormally with code 1, a generic code
for failure. The easiest way to search for this bug is to insert informative
messages in the code, like

@example
DATA_SECTION
  !! cout << "DATA_SECTION begins" << endl;
  ...
  !! cout << "DATA_SECTION ends" << endl;
@end example

@noindent
and/or simplify the model, possibly by commenting out parts of the code. After
narrowing the search step by step, the problematic line(s) can be changed or
removed. To comment or uncomment large parts of code, use the @kbd{M-;}
keystroke (@pxref{Keybindings}).

@page

@subsec Example 4: Strange results

@noindent
Create a bug by dividing by zero in a @code{PROCEDURE_SECTION} assignment:
@code{pred_Y=a*x+b;} @arrow{} @code{pred_Y=a*x+b/0;}. Then click the
@icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8} to build the model (this time there
is no compiler warning). Click @icon{icon-jump-to} or press @key{f9} to run the
model:

@screen{bug-strange}

The ADMB on-screen report indicates successful convergence (exit code 0) with an
objective function value of @samp{-1.#INDe+000}, while Emacs reports failure
(exit code 1). The easiest way to search for this bug is to insert informative
messages in the code, like

@example
PROCEDURE_SECTION
  cout << "The value of a   is: " << a   << endl;
  cout << "The value of a*x is: " << a*x << endl;
  cout << "The value of b   is: " << b   << endl;
  cout << "The value of b/0 is: " << b/0 << endl;
  cout << "The value of f   is: " << f   << endl;
@end example

@noindent
and/or simplify the model, possibly by commenting out parts of the code. A more
advanced option is to use a debugger.

@page

@subsec GDB: When the going gets tough
@anchor{GDB}

@noindent
GNU Emacs and GCC can interact closely with the GDB debugger---these programs
were all created by the same programmer, Richard Stallman. A program must
fulfill two conditions before debugging:

@itemize
@item The model executable (e.g., @file{simple.exe}) must build successfully,
so a debugger is only helpful for bugs of type 3 and 4 (@pxref{Types of bugs}).
@item The model executable must include debugging symbols. To embed debugging
symbols with AD Studio, either select ``Debug'' compilation from the
@clickthis{ADMB @click{} Target} menu, or press @kbd{C-- g} (@key{Ctrl} and
@key{-}, then @key{g}), followed by @key{return}.
@end itemize

Using GDB to debug an ADMB model is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but when
simpler debugging methods fail, it is time to click @clickthis{Tools @click{}
Debugger (GDB)}:

@screen{bug-gdb}

@chapter TMB tutorial

@section Create a working directory

Open AD Studio and create a working directory called @file{c:/demo}:

@example
M-n
c:/demo
C-d
c:/demo
@end example

@noindent
The @kbd{M-n} keystroke means hold @key{Alt} and press @key{n}. This creates
a new directory.

@noindent
The @kbd{C-d} keystroke means hold @key{Ctrl} and press @key{d}. This sets the
current directory.

@noindent
See @ref{Keybindings}, for a full list of AD Studio keybindings.

@section Create a simple model

AD Studio has a built-in example model, which can be used as a minimal template
to create a new model. To create a mini template in the current directory, find
the menu above the editor window and select @clickthis{TMB @click{} Mini
Template} or press @key{f12}.

The screen will now split in two parts, which is the default state of a TMB
session in AD Studio. The TMB model code (C++) is in the main window and the
compilation script (R) in a secondary window. The cursor remains in the TMB
model window, which makes TMB-specific commands available via the menu and
keybindings.

@section Build and run

The compilation script contains R code that compiles and runs the model. There
are two alternative ways to build a TMB model:

@itemize
@item @clickthis{TMB @click{} Build} or @key{f8}: only build the model
@item @clickthis{TMB @click{} Run} or @key{f9}: run R script, typically builds
(if not already built) and runs the model
@end itemize

@subsec Manage buffers

@noindent
The secondary window is now showing either compilation output or an active R
session, but the R script is no longer visible. To switch between the R script,
compilation output, and the R session, select @clickthis{View Script}
(@key{f11}), @clickthis{View Compilation}, or @clickthis{View R Session} in the
TMB menu.

@cartouche
@noindent
Note how the @clickthis{TMB} menu is only available when the active window is in
@command{tmb-mode}. Press @key{f3} at any point to switch a window to
@command{tmb-mode}.
@end cartouche

This is a good time to revisit basic buffer and window management. In Emacs, a
buffer is like a page, often representing a file, but sometimes other things,
like compilation and command output. The Emacs screen is divided into one or
more windows, where each window shows one buffer, while other buffers reside in
the background. Explore the @clickthis{Buffers} menu, as well as buffer-related
@ref{Keybindings}. A window can be split in two by selecting @clickthis{New
Window Below} (@kbd{C-x 2}) or @clickthis{New Window on Right} (@kbd{C-x 3}) in
the @clickthis{File} menu. The @key{escape} key lets one window fill the Emacs
screen.

@section Debug

To debug a TMB model in AD Studio, select @clickthis{TMB @click{} Debug} or
press @key{f10}. This starts an R session that invokes the GNU Debugger (GDB).
To finish the debugging session, type @code{quit} in the @code{(gdb)} prompt.

@chapter Hints and tips

@section Help pages

Both @command{admb-mode} and @command{tmb-mode} come with a help page that is
bound to the @key{f1} key when either of these modes is active. Furthermore, the
Emacs help system has a help page for every function and variable, as well as
keystrokes:

@indentedblock
@multitable @columnfractions .07 .45
@item @kbd{C-h k} @tab Keystroke
@item @kbd{C-h f} @tab Function
@item @kbd{C-h a} @tab Search for command
@item @kbd{C-h v} @tab Variable
@end multitable
@end indentedblock

@section Files

The keystrokes @kbd{C-n}, @kbd{C-o}, @kbd{C-s}, and @kbd{C-w} can be used to
create, open, save, and close files. For convenience, @kbd{C-p} opens any file
that has a similar name as the ADMB/TMB model, for example, @kbd{C-p@tie{}dat}
to open @file{mymodel.dat}. Directories can be created with @kbd{M-n} and
switched to with @kbd{C-d}. To quit AD Studio, press @kbd{C-q}.

@section Cut, copy, paste

These three commands are essential for editing any text, and they form a major
obstacle for users who try Emacs for the first time.

In almost all other editors, @kbd{C-x}, @kbd{C-c}, and @kbd{C-v} are used to
cut, copy, and paste. These are the keybindings that the majority of computer
users have memorized and use in a wide variety of applications. The default
keybindings in Emacs to cut, copy, and paste (@kbd{C-w}, @kbd{M-w}, @kbd{C-y})
are neither intuitive nor easy to memorize at first. Rebinding keystrokes is
easy enough in Emacs, except @kbd{C-x} and @kbd{C-c} are reserved keystrokes in
Emacs, to access many of the most important commands. Rebinding those keystrokes
is questionable, in the same way it would be questionable for an R package to
redefine things like @code{q()} or @code{pi}. There is no perfect solution, but
the alternatives include:

@enumerate
@item Bite the bullet and learn the Emacs defaults.
@item Define keybindings to cut/copy/paste that feel convenient, but are not
@kbd{C-x} or @kbd{C-c}.
@item Load special @code{cua-mode} that overrides the reserved defaults and
binds @kbd{C-x}, @kbd{C-c}, and @kbd{C-v} to cut, copy, and paste.
@end enumerate

@noindent
AD Studio takes the third option: CUA mode. Among the drawbacks is that text is
not reliably copied between applications, not even between Emacs instances.
Workarounds include:

@itemize @minus
@item Copy with @kbd{C-insert} and paste with @kbd{M-insert}.
@item Copy with left mouse button, paste with middle button.
@end itemize

@section Undo/redo

The undo command in AD Studio does both undo and redo. When undo is performed
repeatedly, it goes further back in the undo history. Any command other than
undo will interrupt this sequence, and from that point the previous undo
commands become ordinary changes that can be undone, equivalent to redo. Try,
for example, copying some text and then paste it three times. Now undo three
times, interrupt with a harmless key like the @key{up} arrow, and then undo
again to redo. To undo all changes since last save, it's easiest to reload using
the @key{f5} key.

@section Comment/uncomment

The @kbd{M-;} key comments or uncomments the highlighted code region, depending
on whether the region is already commented or not.

@section Secondary window

The default state of an AD Studio session is with the screen split in two parts,
with the ADMB/TMB model code (TPL/C++) in the main window and something else in
a secondary window. This secondary window can be navigated without leaving the
main window, using intuitive keybindings: @kbd{M-up}, @kbd{M-down},
@kbd{M-pgup}, @kbd{M-pgdn}, @kbd{M-home}, @kbd{M-end}.

If the secondary window contains compilation output, @kbd{M-up} and @kbd{M-down}
will navigate between error messages instead of lines.

@section Alt key

AD Studio does not emulate exactly the way many editors open menus with the
@key{Alt} key. To open the @clickthis{Edit} menu, for example, it is not enough
to press @key{Alt} and @key{e} simultaneously. AD Studio provides four ways to
open the @clickthis{Edit} menu:

@enumerate
@item Mouse click on the menu bar
@item Tap @key{Alt} first and then @key{e} (Windows)
@item Hold @key{Alt} and tap @key{e} twice (Windows)
@item Hold @key{Alt} and tap @key{f}, then release @key{Alt} and tap @key{right}
arrow (Linux)
@end enumerate

The idea behind AD Studio, however, is that users can memorize intuitive
keystrokes to undo, cut, copy, paste, find, replace, and goto line, without
opening the @clickthis{Edit} menu. Also don't forget that AD Studio is open
source, so users are free to modify any part of the program, including the
keybindings defined in the @file{.emacs} file.

@section Vi keybindings

Longtime users of the Vi editor can turn on Emacs @command{viper-mode}, which is
a full-featured Vi emulator for Emacs.

@chapter Configuration
@anchor{Configuration}

@section Personal @code{.emacs} file

@noindent
AD Studio is intended for people who don't know Emacs, are not interested in
learning it, and will only use it to work with ADMB. The design goal is that AD
Studio should work out of the box and get the job done with minimum fuss.

It is, however, in the nature of modellers to experiment and improve. Users who
modify the original @file{.emacs} file are no longer using AD Studio, but Emacs
with packages and a personal @file{.emacs} file. One reason to modify the
@file{.emacs} file or write a new one from scratch is to install additional
Emacs packages. Another reason is to redefine the keybindings, perhaps closer to
the Emacs defaults. Other reasons include setting fonts and colors, setting user
variables, or defining new user functions. Users with a personal @file{.emacs}
file can update ADMB, GCC, GDB, Emacs and packages independently.

Note that it is not advisable to configure Emacs by clicking @clickthis{Options
@click{} Save Options} or @clickthis{Options @click{} Customize Emacs}. Editing
the @file{.emacs} file directly is a more reliable and transparent approach. See
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs} for guidelines.

@subsec Example

@noindent
The @key{f10} key in @command{admb-mode} runs @command{admb-rep} to a open a
report file:

@smallexample
(local-set-key [f10] 'admb-rep) ; menu-bar-open
@end smallexample

@noindent
The semicolon starts a comment, reminding that the default behavior of Emacs is
to run @command{menu-bar-open} when @key{f10} is pressed. In AD Studio, it is
easy to activate the menu bar with the mouse or the @key{Alt} key, so @key{f10}
can be used for something else.

Some users may find it practical to open the report file in an external browser,
rather than inside AD Studio. The report file is often best viewed in a large
window, and the AD Studio windows are somewhat busy showing other things. It is
easy to rebind the @key{f10} key,

@smallexample
(local-set-key [f10] 'admb-rep-browser) ; menu-bar-open
@end smallexample

@noindent
but as mentioned in the documentation of @command{admb-rep-browser}, the
@file{.rep} file ending in Windows may need to be associated with the desired
browser program, Firefox or the like.

@section Custom startup

@noindent
It can be practical to have AD Studio available, while using a personal
@file{.emacs} file for most Emacs sessions. For example, an experienced Emacs
user may want to test how AD Studio works, or demonstrate it to colleagues,
without constantly shuffling @file{.emacs} files. In Windows, one can place the
AD Studio @file{.emacs} file in @code{c:/~/adstudio} and then start AD Studio
with the shell command:

@smallexample
c:/gnu/emacs/bin/runemacs.exe -Q -l c:/~/adstudio/.emacs
@end smallexample

The @option{-Q} option tells Emacs to ignore the default startup file(s) and
@option{-l} tells it to load a Lisp file. This command can be used in a start
menu or desktop shortcut, with the @code{c:/~/icons/ad.ico} decorative icon, and
similar tricks can be used in Linux and Mac.

@chapter Troubleshooting
@anchor{Troubleshooting}

@section{General usage}

@subsec The ADMB/TMB menu and toolbar icons disappear

@noindent
These only appear when the current buffer is in @command{admb-mode} or
@command{tmb-mode}. Either switch to a source code buffer that is already in
@command{admb-mode} or @command{tmb-mode}, or press @key{f2} or @key{f3} in the
current buffer. Other modes may have special menus and toolbar icons that are
useful for that mode, see for example the @ref{GDB,,GDB screenshot}.

@subsec The @key{Tab} key does not indent code properly

@noindent
ADMB Mode does not know the appropriate indentation of every line, so generally
users indent their code manually using @key{Space} and @key{Backspace}. The
@key{Tab} key is programmed to insert a number of spaces, as suggested by the
previous line, which is sometimes useful.

@subsec Lines end with strange @code{^M} characters

@noindent
This is how Emacs shows Dos line endings, although in most cases Dos line
endings are handled more gracefully. It could be that the file contains mixed
line endings (both Dos and Unix), and the simplest solution is to delete all
@code{^M} characters. This can be done using the @key{M-,} key that deletes all
trailing whitespace. It could also be that the Emacs variable
@code{file-name-buffer-file-type-alist} matches the @file{.tpl} file ending, and
the simplest solution is to set that variable to @code{nil}.

@subsec Clicking (@clickthis{ADMB @click{} Run Makefile}) or (@clickthis{TMB
@click{} Make}) returns an error

@noindent
Makefiles are a sophisticated build automation tool, not required for general
ADMB or TMB usage. This command invokes the @command{make} program that looks
for a file called @file{Makefile}. If the @command{make} program or the makefile
is not found, an error is returned. This feature is provided for advanced users
who have prepared a makefile in the working directory.

@section{Configuration}

@subsec Double-clicking a @file{.tpl} file does not open it in Emacs

@noindent
The @file{.tpl} file ending needs to be associated with Emacs. This can be done
with registry entries or in Windows Explorer folder options.

@subsec Emacs cannot load @command{admb-mode} or @command{tmb-mode}

@noindent
The directory containing the @file{admb.el} file needs to be in the Emacs
variable @code{load-path}, and the @command{admb-mode} command needs to be
autoloaded in the @file{.emacs} configuration file. The same holds for
@file{tmb.el} and other Emacs packages.

@subsec ADMB compilation commands not recognized

@noindent
The @env{PATH} environment variable needs to point to the directories containing
the compilation programs (@command{tpl2cpp}, @command{tpl2rem}), scripts
(@command{admb}, @command{adcomp}, @command{adlink}), and the
@command{g++} program. Likewise, the @env{ADMB_HOME} environment variable
needs to point to the main ADMB directory. Windows environment variables can be
set using Dos scripts like @code{c:/~/bat/admb-set.bat}, or by right-clicking
the My Computer icon, then @clickthis{Properties @click{} Advanced @click{}
Environment Variables @click{} User variables @click{} New}.

Limited user (i.e., non-administrator) accounts in Windows can also prevent the
ADMB-IDE installer from setting the environment variables @env{ADMB_HOME} and @env{PATH}.
In those cases, the right-click-properties method described above can be used to
set the variables after the installation. Many Linux distributions include only
the C component of GCC, so users need to install the optional C++ component
before using ADMB.

@subsec Conflicting compilers and libraries
@anchor{Conflicting compilers and libraries}

@noindent
When developing models using ADMB or TMB, it is important to have only one C++
compiler in the PATH. Likewise, a maximum of one version of ADMB should be in
the PATH. Otherwise, errors will occur as objects and libraries of different
versions are linked together.

AD Studio uses the C++ compiler that comes with Rtools, which should be used for
compiling both ADMB and TMB models. If other C++ compilers are on the machine,
it may be necessary to remove them the PATH, either by modifying the PATH
environment variable, or temporarily renaming directories.
