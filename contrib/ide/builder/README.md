The ADMB-IDE build procedure consists of four scripts:

```
        ide-components.bat      ->  [components]
                |
       ide-distribution.bat     ->  [distribution]
                |
        +-------+-------+
        |               |
ide-installer.iss  ide-zip.bat  ->  admb-ide.exe, admb-ide.zip
```
