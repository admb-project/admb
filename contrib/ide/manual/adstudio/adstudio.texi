@chapter Preamble

@section Credit

AD Model Builder (ADMB) was written by David Fournier at Otter Research in
Canada, and Template Model Builder (TMB) was written by Kasper Kristensen at DTU
Aqua in Denmark.

@section Simplified Emacs

The main purpose of AD Studio is to make the convenient Emacs features of
@command{admb-mode} and @command{tmb-mode} available to non-Emacs users. In
other words, to disable the standard Emacs behavior.

@cartouche
@noindent
Experienced Emacs users may prefer to ignore the AD Studio @file{.emacs} file,
and simply install and load ADMB Mode (@file{admb.el}) and TMB Mode
(@file{tmb.el}) like other Emacs packages. They are written as standard ``major
modes'' that follow all Emacs mode conventions.
@end cartouche

@chapter AD Studio overview

@section Statistical modelling

Developing statistical models in ADMB and TMB is an iterative process that
involves writing, compiling, testing, and debugging. AD Studio has been designed
specifically to allow the user to perform these tasks more efficiently than in
other working environments.

GNU Emacs is a complex and powerful editor that comes with particularly good
support for C++, R, @LaTeX, backup/version control, and other useful features
for statistical computing. The dedicated ADMB and TMB modes provide syntax
highlighting, compilation, file manipulation, outline code navigation,
templates, and smaller tools for developing models. Emacs users can download
@file{admb-mode.el} and @command{tmb-mode.el} and start using them right away,
after reading the commentary at the top of these files.

The problem with Emacs is that it requires considerable time to learn and
configure, although for advanced statistical computing this can be a rewarding
investment. As the programmer Larry Wall once said: ``If ease of use was the
highest goal, we'd all be driving golf carts.'' The
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs} page contains some pointers
for setting up and learning Emacs. There are, however, good reasons why many
users may not feel like adopting Emacs as their main editor, but would still
appreciate a dedicated environment for ADMB and TMB.

The rest of this tutorial demonstrates how AD Studio can used without learning
the details of Emacs. This is achieved with an unusual @file{.emacs}
configuration file that emulates common keybindings of basic editors, while
disabling some of the most used Emacs keybindings. This @file{.emacs} file is
therefore not intended for experienced Emacs users, although they may find it an
interesting read.

@section Software components

AD Model Builder (@strong{ADMB}) and Template Model Builder (@strong{TMB}) are
software platforms that utilize automatic differentiation (AD) and Laplace
approximation to estimate parameters and random effects in a fast and reliable
way. ADMB and TMB generally give the same model fit, but they offer different
features. ADMB is a stand-alone application that tends to have better MCMC
functionality, while TMB is an R package that has more convenient and faster
estimation of random effects.

The @strong{Emacs} editor has dedicated modes for editing different file types
and for other tasks. In addition to standard Emacs features, AD Studio includes
modes to work with ADMB, @LaTeX, Markdown, R, and TMB.

The @strong{GCC} C++ compiler and @strong{GDB} debugger are provided by Rtools.
By using the same compiler to build ADMB and TMB models, AD Studio makes it easy
to work with ADMB and TMB on the same machine without running into compiler
version conflicts.

@section Installation

AD Studio consists of components that can be set up individually by hand
(Windows, Linux, Mac) or using an installer (Windows).

@subsec Installer

@noindent
The Windows installer @file{@value{INSTALLER}.exe} sets up ADMB, GCC, GDB,
Emacs, and the Emacs packages, along with file associations and environment
variables to glue everything together. Users are expected to install R and TMB
on their own, as these are frequently updated.

@sp
@center @image{intro-install,9cm}

@noindent
Once installed, the software components reside in four different root directories:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .35
@item Directory        @tab Component
@item @code{c:/~}      @tab Emacs packages and settings
@item @code{c:/admb}   @tab ADMB
@item @code{c:/gnu}    @tab Emacs
@item @code{c:/Rtools} @tab Rtools
@end multitable

@noindent
This directory structure can be practical for setting up other free statistical
software, such as R. By separating the main program (@code{c:/gnu/r}) from the
user settings (@code{c:/~/.Rprofile, c:/~/Rconsole}) and user libraries
(@code{c:/~/r/library}), the main program can be removed and upgraded without
affecting the user setup.

One thing to keep in mind is that the installer modifies the user @env{PATH} and
file associations. In rare cases, users may need to reconfigure these according
to taste and needs after installing AD Studio. Advanced users may choose to
deselect these options during the installation for this reason.

@subsec Manual setup

@noindent
Windows users can also set up and configure ADMB, Emacs, and Rtools by hand,
starting from the @file{@value{INSTALLER}.zip} kit. The following guidelines may
be useful for that:

@uref{http://admb-project.org/docs}

@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs/install}

@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs/configure}

@uref{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}

@noindent
See also the chapters on @ref{AD Studio for Linux/Mac}, @ref{Configuration} and
@ref{Troubleshooting} in this manual.

@page

@subsec AD Studio Linux/Mac
@anchor{AD Studio for Linux/Mac}

@noindent
Setting up AD Studio for Linux or Mac is equivalent to the ``manual setup''
described above, so the same guidelines apply. The key steps are:

@enumerate
@item Install ADMB, GNU Emacs, GCC (including the C++ component), and GDB.

@item Download the AD Studio
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/admb-ide/core,@code{.emacs}} configuration
file and place it in @code{~/.emacs} to apply the simplified Emacs user
interface.

@item Download Emacs packages and place inside @code{~/emacs/lisp/admb} to
provide mode-specific syntax highlighting and commands.
@end enumerate

@noindent
The screenshots in the next chapter are from Windows, but AD Studio looks very
similar in Linux:

@screen{intro-linux}

@chapter ADMB tutorial

@section Create a working copy of @command{simple}

First open Windows Explorer and create a folder called @code{c:/simple}. Then
navigate to @code{c:/admb/@value{ADMBDIR}/examples/admb/simple} and copy the
model and data files, creating:

@example
c:/simple/simple.dat
c:/simple/simple.tpl
@end example

Now double-click @file{simple.tpl} in the @code{c:/simple} folder. The file
should open in Emacs in @command{admb-mode} (see red circle) and the code should
be in color:

@screen{tutor-open-circle}

@page

@section Build, run, and view the results

Build the model by clicking the @icon{icon-connect} icon, or press @key{f8}:

@screen{tutor-build-circle}

@page

@noindent
Run the model by clicking the @icon{icon-jump-to} icon, or press @key{f9}:

@screen{tutor-run-circle}

Many ADMB models output their results to a @file{.rep} report file, and AD
Studio provides the @icon{icon-describe} icon and @key{f10} key to open the
report file. The @command{simple} model outputs no report file, but the
parameter estimates, standard errors, and correlations are found in the
@file{.cor} file.

This is an opportunity to introduce basic buffer and window management. In
Emacs, a buffer is like a page, often representing a file, but sometimes other
things, like the compilation and command output buffers in the previous two
screenshots. The Emacs screen is divided into one or more windows, where each
window shows one buffer, while other buffers reside in the background. Explore
the @clickthis{Buffers} menu, as well as @ref{keybindings}.

Try out different ways to open the @file{.cor} file:

@enumerate
@item Press @key{escape} to maximize the active window. Then click the
@icon{icon-open} icon or press @kbd{C-o} (@key{Ctrl} and @key{o}) and select
@code{c:/simple/simple.cor}.
@item Press @key{escape} to maximize the active window, @kbd{C-x 3} to split
into two windows, and select the window on the right with a mouse click or
@key{f6}. Click the @icon{icon-open} icon or press @kbd{C-o} and select
@code{c:/simple/simple.cor}.
@item Click the @clickthis{ADMB @click{} View Estimates} menu entry or press
@kbd{S-f10}.
@item Click the @clickthis{ADMB @click{} View Any} menu entry or press
@kbd{C-p}, then type @samp{cor} and @key{return}.
@end enumerate

@page

@screen{tutor-cor}

After viewing, maximize a window by pressing @key{escape}, or close a window by
clicking the @icon{icon-close} icon or pressing @kbd{C-w} or @kbd{C-f4}.

@cartouche
@noindent
Note how the ADMB menu and toolbar icons are only available when the active
window is in @command{admb-mode}. Press @key{f2} at any point to switch a window
to @command{admb-mode}.
@end cartouche

@page

@section Debug

@b{Types of bugs}
@anchor{Types of bugs}

@noindent
Bugs in ADMB models can be categorized by the point of discovery:

@enumerate
@item @command{tpl2cpp} reports a bug (cannot translate)
@item @command{g++} reports a bug (cannot compile or link)
@item The model builds fine, but crashes or writes no output when run (no
results)
@item The model runs fine, but not like it is supposed to (strange results)
@end enumerate

@subsec Locating bugs

@itemize
@item Warnings or error messages indicate line number, or function/variable name
@item Insert lines of code that print informative messages during runtime
@item Comment out parts of the code
@item Use a debugger
@end itemize

@subsec Example 1: @command{tpl2cpp} reports a bug

@noindent
Create a bug by inserting an extra space inside a vector declaration:
@code{init_vector Y(1,nobs)} @arrow{} @code{init_vector Y(1, nobs)}. Then click
the @icon{icon-disconnect} icon or press @key{f7} to translate TPL to C++:

@screen{bug-tpl}

The @command{tpl2cpp} translator reports an error in line 36 of
@file{simple.tpl}. Click @clickthis{Edit @click{} Go To @click{} Goto Line} or
press @kbd{C-g} to move the cursor to that line, and then remove the unwanted
space.

@page

@subsec Example 2: @command{g++} reports a bug

@noindent
Create a bug by referring to a nonexistent variable: @code{init_vector
Y(1,nobs)} @arrow{} @code{init_vector Y(1,n)}. Then click the
@icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8} to build the model:

@screen{bug-gcc}

The @command{g++} compiler reports an error in line 11 of @file{simple.cpp}.
Click the highlighted filename to open the C++ source file with the cursor in
that line. After realizing what the problem is (with the help of the error
message @t{@i{`n' was not declared in this scope}}), go back to the ADMB code in
@file{simple.tpl} and change the @samp{n} to @samp{nobs}.

@page

@subsec Example 3: No results

@noindent
Create a bug by dividing by zero at the top of the @code{DATA_SECTION}: @code{!!
cout << 1/0 << endl;}. Then click the @icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8}
to build the model. Ignoring the warning, click @icon{icon-jump-to} or press
@key{f9} to run the model:

@screen{bug-nothing}

@sp 0.5

The shell command @command{simple} exits abnormally with code 1, a generic code
for failure. The easiest way to search for this bug is to insert informative
messages in the code, like

@example
DATA_SECTION
  !! cout << "DATA_SECTION begins" << endl;
  ...
  !! cout << "DATA_SECTION ends" << endl;
@end example

@noindent
and/or simplify the model, possibly by commenting out parts of the code. After
narrowing the search step by step, the problematic line(s) can be changed or
removed. To comment or uncomment large parts of code, use the @kbd{M-;}
keystroke (@pxref{keybindings}).

@page

@subsec Example 4: Strange results

@noindent
Create a bug by dividing by zero in a @code{PROCEDURE_SECTION} assignment:
@code{pred_Y=a*x+b;} @arrow{} @code{pred_Y=a*x+b/0;}. Then click the
@icon{icon-connect} icon or press @key{f8} to build the model (this time there
is no compiler warning). Click @icon{icon-jump-to} or press @key{f9} to run the
model:

@screen{bug-strange}

The ADMB on-screen report indicates successful convergence (exit code 0) with an
objective function value of @samp{-1.#INDe+000}, while Emacs reports failure
(exit code 1). The easiest way to search for this bug is to insert informative
messages in the code, like

@example
PROCEDURE_SECTION
  cout << "The value of a   is: " << a   << endl;
  cout << "The value of a*x is: " << a*x << endl;
  cout << "The value of b   is: " << b   << endl;
  cout << "The value of b/0 is: " << b/0 << endl;
  cout << "The value of f   is: " << f   << endl;
@end example

@noindent
and/or simplify the model, possibly by commenting out parts of the code. A more
advanced option is to use a debugger.

@page

@subsec GDB: When the going gets tough
@anchor{GDB}

@noindent
GNU Emacs and GCC can interact closely with the GDB debugger---these programs
were all created by the same programmer, Richard Stallman. A program must
fulfill two conditions before debugging:

@itemize
@item The model executable (e.g., @file{simple.exe}) must build successfully,
so a debugger is only helpful for bugs of type 3 and 4 (@pxref{Types of bugs}).
@item The model executable must include debugging symbols. To embed debugging
symbols with AD Studio, either select ``Debug'' compilation from the
@clickthis{ADMB @click{} Target} menu, or press @kbd{C-- g} (@key{Ctrl} and
@key{-}, then @key{g}), followed by @key{return}.
@end itemize

Using GDB to debug an ADMB model is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but when
simpler debugging methods fail, it is time to click @clickthis{Tools @click{}
Debugger (GDB)}:

ADMB-IDE does not emulate perfectly the way many editors open menus with the
@key{Alt} key. To open the @clickthis{Edit} menu, for example, it is not enough
to press @key{Alt} and @key{e} simultaneously. ADMB-IDE provides four ways to
open the @clickthis{Edit} menu:

@enumerate
@item Mouse click on the menu bar
@item Tap @key{Alt} first and then @key{e} (Windows)
@item Hold @key{Alt} and tap @key{e} twice (Windows)
@item Hold @key{Alt} and tap @key{f}, then release @key{Alt} and tap @key{right}
arrow (Linux)
@end enumerate

The idea behind ADMB-IDE, however, is that users can memorize intuitive
keystrokes to undo, cut, copy, paste, find, replace, and goto line, without
opening the @clickthis{Edit} menu. Also don't forget that ADMB-IDE is open
source, so users are free to modify any part of the program, including the
keybindings defined in the @file{.emacs} file.

Longtime users of the Vi editor can turn on Emacs @command{evil-mode} or
@command{viper-mode}, which are full-featured Vi emulators for Emacs.

@chapter Configuration
@anchor{Configuration}

@subsec Personal @code{.emacs} file

@noindent
ADMB-IDE is intended for people who don't know Emacs, are not interested in
learning it, and will only use it to work with ADMB. The design goal is that
ADMB-IDE should work out of the box and get the job done with minimum fuss.

It is, however, in the nature of modellers to experiment and improve. Users who
modify the original @file{.emacs} file are no longer using ADMB-IDE, but Emacs
with @code{admb-mode} and a personal @file{.emacs} file. One reason to modify
the @file{.emacs} file or write a new one from scratch is to install additional
Emacs packages. Another reason is to redefine the keybindings, probably closer
to the Emacs defaults. Other reasons include setting fonts and colors, setting
user variables, or defining new user functions. Users with a personal
@file{.emacs} file can update ADMB, Emacs, GCC, GDB, and @code{admb-mode}
independently, or salvage pieces from a recent ADMB-IDE zip bundle.

Note that it is not advisable to configure Emacs by clicking @clickthis{Options
@click{} Save Options} or @clickthis{Options @click{} Customize Emacs}. Editing
the @file{.emacs} file directly is a more reliable and transparent approach. See
@uref{http://admb-project.org/tools/editors/emacs} for guidelines.

@subsec Example

@noindent
The @key{f10} key in ADMB-IDE runs @command{admb-rep} to a open a report file:

@smallexample
(local-set-key [f10]   'admb-rep            ) ; menu-bar-open
@end smallexample

@noindent
The semicolon starts a comment, reminding that the default behavior of Emacs is
to run @command{menu-bar-open} when @key{f10} is pressed. In ADMB-IDE, it is
easy to activate the menu bar with the mouse or the @key{Alt} key, so @key{f10}
can be used for something else. The liberal spacing is to align surrounding
lines of code, but neither the comment nor multiple spaces are necessary.

Some users may find it practical to open the report file in an external browser,
rather than inside ADMB-IDE. The report file is often best viewed in a large
window, and the ADMB-IDE windows are somewhat busy showing other things. It is
easy to rebind the @key{f10} key,

@smallexample
(local-set-key [f10]   'admb-rep-browser    ) ; menu-bar-open
@end smallexample

@noindent
but as mentioned in the documentation of @command{admb-rep-browser}, the
@file{.rep} file ending in Windows may need to be associated with the desired
browser program, Firefox or the like.

@subsec Canned ADMB-IDE

@noindent
It can be practical to make a canned version of ADMB-IDE available, while using
a different @file{.emacs} file for most Emacs sessions. For example, an
experienced Emacs user may want to test how ADMB-IDE works, or demonstrate it to
colleagues, without constantly shuffling @file{.emacs} files. In Windows, one
can place the ADMB-IDE @file{.emacs} file in @code{c:/admb/ide} and then start
ADMB-IDE with the shell command:

@smallexample
c:/gnu/emacs/bin/runemacs.exe -Q -l c:/admb/ide/.emacs -f admb-mode
@end smallexample

The @option{-Q} option tells Emacs to ignore the default startup file(s), the
@option{-l} tells it to load a Lisp file, and the @option{-f} tells it to call a
function. This command can be used in a start menu or desktop shortcut, with the
@code{c:/~/icons/admb64.ico} decorative icon, and similar tricks can be used in
Linux and Mac.

@chapter Troubleshooting
@anchor{Troubleshooting}

@section{General usage}

@subsec The ADMB menu and toolbar icons disappear

@noindent
These only appear when the current buffer is in @command{admb-mode}. Either
switch to a @file{.tpl} buffer that is already in @command{admb-mode}, or press
@key{f2} to switch to @command{admb-mode} in the current buffer. Other modes may
have special menus and toolbar icons that are useful for that mode, see for
example the @ref{GDB,,GDB screenshot}.

@subsec Undo/redo

@noindent
The undo command in ADMB-IDE does both undo and redo. When undo is performed
repeatedly, it goes further back in the undo history. Any command other than
undo will interrupt this sequence, and from that point the previous undo
commands become ordinary changes that can be undone, equivalent to redo. Try,
for example, copying some text and then paste it three times. Now undo three
times, interrupt with a harmless key like the @key{up} arrow, and then undo
again to redo. To undo all changes since last save, it's easiest to reload using
the @key{f5} key.

@subsec The @key{Tab} key does not indent code properly

@noindent
ADMB-IDE does not know the appropriate indentation of every line, so generally
users indent their code manually using @key{Space} and @key{Backspace}. The
@key{Tab} key is programmed to insert a number of spaces, as suggested by the
previous line, which is sometimes useful.

@subsec Lines end with strange @code{^M} characters

@noindent
This is how Emacs shows Dos line endings, although in most cases Dos line
endings are handled more gracefully. It could be that the file contains mixed
line endings (both Dos and Unix), and the simplest solution is to delete all
@code{^M} characters. It could also be that the Emacs variable
@code{file-name-buffer-file-type-alist} matches the @file{.tpl} file ending, and
the simplest solution is to set that variable to @code{nil}.

@subsec Clicking @clickthis{ADMB @click{} Run Makefile} returns an error

@noindent
Makefiles are a sophisticated build automation tool, not required for general
ADMB usage. This command invokes the @command{make} program that looks for a
file called @file{Makefile}. If the @command{make} program or the makefile is
not found, an error is returned. This feature is provided for advanced users who
have prepared a makefile in the working directory.

@section{Configuration}

@subsec Double-clicking a @file{.tpl} file does not open it in Emacs

@noindent
The @file{.tpl} file ending needs to be associated with Emacs. This can be done
with registry entries or in Windows Explorer folder options.

@subsec Emacs cannot load @command{admb-mode}

@noindent
The directory containing the @file{admb.el} file needs to be in the Emacs
variable @code{load-path}, and the @command{admb-mode} command needs to be
autoloaded in the @file{.emacs} configuration file.

@page

@subsec Compilation commands are not recognized

@noindent
The @env{PATH} environment variable needs to point to the directories containing
the compilation programs (@command{tpl2cpp}, @command{tpl2rem}), scripts
(@command{admb}, @command{adcomp}, @command{adlink}), and the
@command{g++} program. Likewise, the @env{ADMB_HOME} environment variable
needs to point to the main ADMB directory. Windows environment variables can be
set using Dos scripts like @code{c:/~/bat/admb-set.bat}, or by right-clicking
the My Computer icon, then @clickthis{Properties @click{} Advanced @click{}
Environment Variables @click{} User variables @click{} New}.

Limited user (i.e., non-administrator) accounts in Windows can also prevent the
ADMB-IDE installer from setting the environment variables @env{ADMB_HOME} and @env{PATH}.
In those cases, the right-click-properties method described above can be used to
set the variables after the installation. Many Linux distributions include only
the C component of GCC, so users need to install the optional C++ component
before using ADMB.

@subsec Conflicting compilers and libraries
@anchor{Conflicting compilers and libraries}

@noindent
When developing models using ADMB, it is important to have only one C++ compiler
and one ADMB version in the PATH. Otherwise, errors will occur as objects and
libraries of different versions are linked together.

For example, the Rtools collection includes a C++ compiler that should be
removed from the PATH, unless ADMB was originally built using that compiler. One
can either modify the PATH environment variable, or temporarily rename
directories (e.g., @file{Rtools} to @file{Rtools_}) so they are not in the PATH
while building models with ADMB.
