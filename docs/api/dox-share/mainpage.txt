<ul>
  <li> Documentation of mathematical functions can be found in the 
"Function Reference" tab.</li>
  <li> C++ class documentation can be found in the "Classes" tab. </li>
  <li> Documentation for global funtions and source code listings can be found in the "Source Code" tab. </li>
  <li> The "Related Pages" tab contains a list of deprecated code and is under construction. </li>

This version of the API documentation is a work in progress.
Partial documentation of some of the AUTODIF Library and ADMB classes can
found on the "Classes" and "Source Code" tabs. Most classes are not
fully documented, but see class \ref dvector for an example of 
how it might look.
If you would like to contribute your expertize to the enterprize please 
contact developers@admb-project.org.

Comments on groupings

/**  \defgroup matop Vector and Matrix Operations. 
\details The syntax of ADMB Matrix and vector operations follows normal
mathematical conventions as much as possible. If \c u and \c v are
vectors and \c M is a matrix, \code u*M \endcode is a normal matrix
multiplication and \code u*v \endcode is a dot product. 
Element-wise multiplications and divisions are accomplished by
\ref elem_prod and \ref elem_div respectively. 
If the arguments to these operations are not conformable for the appropriate
type and operation, the application will exit with an error message.

These operations have been overloaded for appropriate combinations of
constant and variable objects. 
The overloaded versions with variable
types are optimized for efficient derivative computation. 
Only the constant types are currently documented here.

  \defgroup RA RETURN_ARRAY_INCREMENT and RETURN_ARRAY_DECREMENT 
   \details
  These functions must be called in any function that returns
  a "variable" object, ie dvariable, dvar_vector, ... Failure to do so
  may generate an error message related to an overflow in the 
  RETURN_ARRAYS stack, or even worse cause derivatives to be incorrect.

/**
  \defgroup AD Classes for Automatic Differentiation.
   \details
   The algorithms for AD  in ADMB are invoked by declaring variables to be
   instances of specific classes, usually of type dvariable. Operations on instances of these classes invoke specialized overloaded 
   operators and functions to the required computations and to automatically 
   compute the required deravitives.

/** \defgroup  GDBPRINTLIB Debugging Tools
    \ingroup CONTRIB
    \details Functions for printing ADMB objects during GDB sessions.
  This functioniality was added to allow easy
  viewing of ADMB variables of all types during a GDB debugging session, but
  the functions can be used in code.
  To use the functions in a GDB session, ADMB must have been built from source
  in debug mode, typically using the command 'make debug'. Also, the model
  TPL must have been compiled using the debug flag, typically using the command
  'admb -g '.
