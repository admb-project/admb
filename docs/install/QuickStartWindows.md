AD Studio
---------

Alternatively, install [AD Studio](https://github.com/admb-project/adstudio), a
dedicated environment for developing ADMB and TMB models. It uses the C++
compiler from Rtools and has especially good support for R, LaTeX, Markdown,
GDB, and Git.

AD Studio 1.0 comes with ADMB 12.0, which is one version older than 12.1.
