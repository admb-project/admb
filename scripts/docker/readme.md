ADMB Docker Containers
======================

Describe ADMB Docker and quickstarts to use the containers.

Docker
------

Using a Docker container simplifies installation and usage of the ADMB software.  A container is similar to a virtual machine running on a local computer, but it is scaled down to mainly to provide command line programs and limited services.  One of the main benefits of using a Docker container is that all the tools and dependencies for the ADMB software are already preinstalled into the container.  Once the ADMB Docker container is downloaded, it is ready to start building and running models.
