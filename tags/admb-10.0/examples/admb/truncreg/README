To run the eample just  gove to the directory containg 
the program truncreg.exe and truncreg.dat as well as the bat files
runtrunc.bat and fruntrunc.bat and ente the 
command

       runtrunc 

Depending on how much memory you have the program will
run faster using larger ADMB buffers by using the
command

       fruntrunc

After you run the program you fill finsd the parameter 
estimates togehtre with their estimated std devs in the
file truncreg.std.

A description of the truncated regression
