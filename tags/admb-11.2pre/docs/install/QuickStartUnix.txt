Describe ADMB build and installation procedures for Unix operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, Solaris and BSD.

---

Prerequisites
-------------

The following programs should be installed on the local computer.

* GNU sed
* GNU flex
* GNU make
* C++ compiler
* _**Optional**_ &mdash; Subversion Client to download from source version control.

_**Note** &mdash; For MacOS, install XCode with command line tools includes all the prerequistes._

Quick Start
-----------

1. Open a **Terminal** window

2. **Download** ADMB

       To get the most current code, download from directly from 
       ADMB version control using the command below.

           [~]$ svn checkout http://www.admb-project.org/svn/trunk admb

       This will copy admb trunk folder to _~/admb/_.

       If **unable** to checkout, download [full source distribution](http://www.admb-project.org/buildbot/snapshots/admb-latest-src.zip).

       Use the command below to extract to _~/admb/_. 

           [~]$ unzip admb.zip

3. Change to admb directory

           [~]$ cd admb

4. **Build** ADMB

       To build ADMB, use the commands below.

           [~/admb/]$ make

       If debug symbols are needed, use the commands below.

           [~/admb/]$ make debug

       _**Note** &mdash; When completed, `~/admb/build/dist` is the binary distribution directory._

5. **Test** ADMB

       _Test the build on a simple example before installing._

       The following commands build and run the simple example.

           [~/admb/]$ cd examples/admb/simple
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb simple.tpl
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ ./simple

       For MinGW and Cygwin shells, use the **'admb.sh'** script.

           [~/admb/]$ cd examples/admb/simple
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb.sh simple.tpl
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ ./simple

6. _**Installation**_

       Installs binary distribution folder to /usr/local/ as super-user.

           [~/admb/]$ sudo make install

       _Use the Manual Installation below if the command above does not work._

7. _**Optional**_ &mdash; Manual Installation    

       _The dist folder can be copied to other computers with similar configurations._

       Follow the procedure below to avoid typing the directory 
       when calling the admb script.

       Copy binary distribution folder to /usr/local/ as super-user.

           [~/admb/]$ sudo cp -Rvf build/dist /usr/local/admb

       Create symlink to main admb script.  Directory _/usr/local/bin/_ should already exist.

           [~/admb/]$ sudo ln -sf /usr/local/admb/admb /usr/local/bin/admb

       After copying, build and run the simple example.

           [~/admb/]$ cd examples/admb/simple
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ admb simple.tpl
           [~/admb/examples/admb/simple/]$ ./simple
