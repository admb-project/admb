*Released May 10, 2013*  

Describe release changes and features.

---

Release Notes
-------------
The goal for all releases was to improve algorithms, add new requested features,
correct defects (bugs), and streamline installation and build process.

ADMB-dev
--------

###Changes and Improvements
* Added description documentation to the programming interface.
* Improvements to admb scripts (see New Features).
* Added more unit tests for improved code coverage. 
* Fixed reported and found bugs.
* Fixed compilers warnings.

###New Supported Compilers

* GNU C++ 4.8 compiler

###New Features

* Add debug target to build files.

  `$ make debug`

* Add shared target to build files (Unix only).

  `$ make shared`

* admb scripts can be called directly and do not require setting enviromental variables
  ADMB_HOME and PATH.

  For Unix, 
  [~/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb simple

  For Windows, 
  C:\simple\> C:\admb\admb simple

* admb scripts can build C++ source files and link.

  For Unix, 
  [~/simple/]$ ~/admb/admb simple.tpl mysource.cpp

  For Windows, 
  C:\simple\> C:\admb\admb simple.tpl mysource.cpp

* admb scripts have a new option -f for optimized library "OPT_LIB".

* admb scripts have a new option -c for only building object files.

###To Do

The following are planned or requested features for the next release.
* Migrating ADMB Subversion Version Control to Git
* Migrating ADMB Redmine Issue Tracking to Git
* Merge Threading Code to trunk
* Write Design Documentation
* Write Developer Documentation

ADMB-11.1
---------

###Changes

* Updated Visual Studio nmake build files.

* Improved Unix build files. Only outdated files are rebuilt.
  
  Note: Building from source will create distribution folder in
        build/dist instead of build/os-comiler-arch.

* Combined mulitple libraries to a single library 'libadmb.a'. 

* Reverted some algorithms to previous version-9 code.

* The compilation scripts (adcomp, adlink, admb) compile in "safe" mode by 
  default.

  To build with optimized libraries use option 

  `$ admb -O model.tpl`

* added 's' option with the Ctrl^C

* contributed libraries are built with the main libraries.
 
* flex is not needed to build ADMB, but it is needed to develop the tpl2cpp.lex 
  and tpl2rem.lex files.

###New Features
* admb script can now build tpl models without the need to set ADMB_HOME
  or PATH. For example, 

  `[~/admb-11.1/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb-11.1/admb simple`

* Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
  directory 'contrib'. Read 'contrib/README.txt'.

* New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

* New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
  equivalent to norm2().

* New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
  than using M_PI or other compiler-specific constants.

* New shell command 'ad2csv' to write binary files to screen 
  or to a file.

* admb is now able to handle .obj, .cpp and .tpl files on
  the commandline.

  For example,

  `$ admb model.tpl supportcode.cpp anotherfile.cpp`

  Output is executable 'model'.

###Bug Fixes

* Catch exit errors for adlink and adcomp.

* Watch out for spaces in admb scripts

* Fix memory leaks.
