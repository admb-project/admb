Describe changes and new features in this release.

Release Notes
=============
The goal for all releases was to improve algorithms, add new requested features,
correct defects (bugs), and streamline installation and build process.

Changes
-------

* Updated Visual Studio nmake build files.

* Improved build files.  Build will not rebuild an already built
  object file.
  
  Note: Building from source will create distribution folder in
        build/dist instead of build/os-comiler-arch.

* Combined libraries to a single library libadmb.a. 

* Reverted some algorithms to previous version 9 code.

* Safe library is now the default build option.  To build with
  Optimized libraries use option 

  $ admb --use-optimized model.tpl

* s option with the control^c was added???

* contributed libraries are built with the main libraries.
 
* flex is not needed to build ADMB, but it is needed to develop the tpl2cpp.lex 
  and tpl2rem.lex files.

* The compilation scripts (adcomp, adlink, admb) compile in "safe" mode by 
  default.

New Features
------------
* admb script can now build tpl models without the need to set ADMB_HOME
  or PATH. For example, 

  [~/admb-11.1/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb-11.1/admb simple

* Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
  directory 'contrib'. Read 'contrib/README.txt'.

* New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

* New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
  equivalent to norm2().

* New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
  than using M_PI or other compiler-specific constants.

* New shell command 'ad2csv' to write binary files to screen 
  or to a file.

* admb is now able to handle .obj, .cpp and .tpl files on
  the commandline.

  For example,

  $ admb model.tpl supportcode.cpp anotherfile.cpp

  Output is executable 'model'.

Bug Fixes
----------

* Able to build ADMB without flex.

* Fix geolocation test.

* Catch exit errors for adlink and adcomp.

* Watch out for spaces in admb scripts

* Fix memory leaks.
