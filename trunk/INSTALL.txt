Describe ADMB installation from source and binary distributions.

Requirements
============
ADMB has been tested and used on Windows and Linux operating systems in both 32
and 64 bit versions. A C/C++ compiler must be be installed on the local computer.

Below is a list of supported compilers:
 * GNU gcc version 4.7
 * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and 2012
 * MacOS XCode(with the Command Line Tools) version 4.6
 * Clang version 3.0
 * Intel C++ Compiler 11
 * Solaris Studio 12

If the compiler is not listed, try building from the source distribution. Email
users@admb-project.org for help.

Download
========
Source and precompiled binary distributions can be downloaded from
http://www.admb-project.org/downloads/

Quick Start
===========

Windows
-------

1. Download ADMB source distribution.

   http://admb-project.org/buildbot/snapshots/admb-latest-src.zip

   Right click the downloaded file and extract to C:\admb-trunk\.

2. Open Comand Prompt window.

3. Change to admb directory.

   C:\> cd admb-trunk

4. Install MinGW C++ compiler (32 Bit).

   C:\admb-trunk\> utilities\make --directory=utilities\mingw
   C:\admb-trunk\> utilities\mingw-install.bat
   If mingw is already installed, then just update it.

   Note: This will download approximately ~177M from 'sourceforge.net'.

   Add MinGW to PATH.

   C:\admb-trunk\> set PATH=C:\admb-trunk\utilities\mingw\bin;%PATH%

   To avoid this just check if admb-cfg.txt has mingw path in the admb script.

5. Build libraries

   C:\admb-trunk\> utilities\make

   Note: Build times vary from machine to machine, but it usually
         takes approximately 15-25 minutes.

   After building libraries, build and run the simple example.

   C:\admb-trunk\> cd examples\admb\simple
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> C:\admb-trunk\build\dist\bin\admb simple
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> simple

   Note: Should be below
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> C:\admb-trunk\admb simple

Windows and Visual C++
----------------------

1. Download ADMB source distribution.

   http://admb-project.org/buildbot/snapshots/admb-latest-src.zip

   Right click the downloaded file and extract to C:\admb-trunk\.

2. Open Visual Studio Comand Prompt window.

3. Change to admb directory.

   C:\> cd admb-trunk

4. Build libraries

   C:\admb-trunk\> nmake

   Note: Build times vary from machine to machine, but it usually
         takes approximately 15-25 minutes.

   After building libraries, build and run the simple example.

   C:\admb-trunk\> cd examples\admb\simple
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> C:\admb-trunk\build\dist\bin\admb simple
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> simple

   Note: Should be below
   C:\admb-trunk\examples\admb\simple\> C:\admb-trunk\admb simple

Unix
----

1. Download ADMB source distribution.

   http://admb-project.org/buildbot/snapshots/admb-latest-src.zip

2. Open Terminal windows.

3. Extract files in HOME directory.

   [~]$ unzip admb-latest-src.zip

   Note: This will extract admb-trunk folder to HOME.

3. Change to admb directory.

   [~]$ cd admb-trunk

4. Build libraries 

   [~/admb-trunk/]$ make

   Note: Build times vary from machine to machine, but it usually
         takes approximately 15-25 minutes.

   If you are NOT using the default C++ compiler, specify compiler on
   the command line.  For example,

   [~/admb-trunk/]$ make icpc

   Use help to show available compiler targets.

   [~/admb-trunk/]$ make help

   After the building the libraries, build run the simple example.

   [~/admb-trunk/]$ cd examples/admb/simple
   [~/admb-trunk/examples/admb/simple/]$ ~/admb-trunk/admb simple
   [~/admb-trunk/examples/admb/simple/]$ ./simple

5. [Optional] Installation

   Copy entire distribution.
   [~/admb-trunk/]$ sudo cp -Rvf ../admb-trunk /usr/local/admb 

   Create symlink to main admb script.
   [~/admb-trunk/]$ sudo ln -sf /usr/local/admb/admb /usr/local/bin

   Note: make install is no longer supported.

   After the copying the libraries, build run the simple example.

   [~/admb-trunk/]$ cd examples/admb/simple
   [~/admb-trunk/examples/admb/simple/]$ admb simple
   [~/admb-trunk/examples/admb/simple/]$ ./simple

Configure Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express
-------------------------------------------
1. Download and install the following software, install them in their default
   locations:
   A. Microsoft .NET 4
   B. Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1
   C. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express

2. Download the executable installer for Windows MSVC from 
   http://admb-project.org/downloads and run it.  Make sure to choose the
   install location as the default C:\ADMB or another location without spaces in
   the name.

3. Add the following to the PATH in the order given. If you are using a 32-bit
   machine, enter only the first, third, fourth, and fifth path listed in that
   order.  If you are using a 64-bit machine, enter all five paths in the order
   listed.  If you are compiling for a 64-bit machine, the second path listed
   here must reflect which architecture you want to compile for, this example
   is for Intel 64-bit processors - for most people this should not be changed.
   Also, if you are on a 32-bit machine, remove the ' (x86)' from these paths.

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\amd64
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE

4. Add the following environment variables:
   INCLUDE   = C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include;
               C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Include

   For the LIB variable, choose either 32-bit or 64-bit.
   32-bit LIB:
   LIB       = C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib;
               C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib 

   64-bit LIB:
   LIB       = C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib\amd64;
               C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib\x64 

5. Logout and login again to make the environment variable changes take effect.
