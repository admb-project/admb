CHANGES IN ADMB VERSION 11.0:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

* [anything that works differently from before, given the
   same input]

* Improved build files.  Build will not rebuild an already built
  object file.
  
  Note: Building from source will create distribution folder in
        build/dist instead of build/os-comiler-arch.

* Use a single library libadmb.a instead of separate libraries. 

* Reverted some algorithms to previous code from version 9.

NEW FEATURES:
* Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
  directory 'contrib', [maybe indicate how that is done].

* New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

* New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
  equivalent to norm2().

* New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
  than using M_PI or other compiler-specific constants.

* New shell command 'ad2csv' to write binary files to screen 
  or to a file.

* [many more]

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

  INSTALLATION:

    * [not the whole installation procedure, only how the
      procedure has changed]
