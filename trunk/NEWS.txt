CHANGES IN ADMB VERSION 11.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * The compilation scripts (adcomp, adlink, admb) compile in
      "safe" mode by default.

    * [anything that works differently from before, given the
      same input]

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
      directory 'contrib', [maybe indicate how that is done].

    * New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

    * New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
      equivalent to norm2().

    * New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
      than using M_PI or other compiler-specific constants.

    * New shell command 'ad2csv' to write binary files to screen
      or to a file.

    * [many more]
