CHANGES IN ADMB VERSION 11.0:

TODO:
[ ] add contrib procedure

[*] fix when no flex problem
[*] fix geolocation test
[*] catch exit errors for adlink and adcomp
[*] simplify admb scripts
[*] VC++ build files
[*] Do gelocation test last in buildbot
    ADMB_HOME=dfdk PATH=kfkdj make --directory=tests/geolocation clean svn all
[ ] Add -o option to rename the output file with path.
[ ] Need to fix flex builds for tpl2cpp and tpl2rem under windows

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

* [anything that works differently from before, given the
   same input]

* Improved build files.  Build will not rebuild an already built
  object file.
  
  Note: Building from source will create distribution folder in
        build/dist instead of build/os-comiler-arch.

* Combined libraries to a single library libadmb.a. 

* Reverted some algorithms to previous code from version 9.

* Safe library is now the default build option.  To build with
  Optimized libraries use option 

  $ admb --use-optimized model.tpl

* s option with the control^c was added???

* contributed libraries are built with the main libraries.
 
* flex is not needed to build ADMB, but it is needed to develop the tpl2cpp.lex 
  and tpl2rem.lex files.

* The compilation scripts (adcomp, adlink, admb) compile in "safe" mode by 
  default.

NEW FEATURES:
* bash admb script can now set ADMB_HOME and PATH.  So, the command below
  will work even though ADMB_HOME is not defined or added to PATH.

  ~/admb/examples/admb/simple$ ~/admb/build/dist/bin/admb simple

* Added "-c" option to admb script to only compile object files

  ~/admb/examples/admb/simple$ ~/admb/build/dist/bin/admb -c simple

  Outputs simple.o

* Functions from user-contributed packages can be loaded from
  directory 'contrib', [maybe indicate how that is done].

  GLOBAL_SECTION
    using admb::contrib;

* New class 'init_table' to read input data into a matrix.

* New function sumsq() to calculate sum of squared values,
  equivalent to norm2().

* New constant PI for 3.141593... Makes models more portable
  than using M_PI or other compiler-specific constants.

* New shell command 'ad2csv' to write binary files to screen 
  or to a file.

* admb is now able to handle .obj, .cpp and .tpl files on
  the commandline.

  Example

  admb model.tpl supportcode.cpp anotherfile.cpp

  Output is executable model

* [many more]

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

  INSTALLATION:

    * [not the whole installation procedure, only how the
      procedure has changed]
