Partial documentation of some of the AUTODIF Library and ADMB classes can
found on the "Classes" tab. No class is 
fully documented. See class \ref dvector for an example of 
how it might look and how to insert documentation.

This preliminary version of the API documentation is a work in progress.

Comments on groupings

/**  \defgroup matop Vector and Matrix Operations. 
\details The syntax of ADMB Matrix and vector operations follows normal
mathematical conventions as much as possible. If \c u and \c v are
vectors and \c M is a matrix, \code u*M \endcode is a normal matrix
multiplication and \code u*v \endcode is a dot product. 
Element-wise multiplications and divisions are accomplished by
\ref elem_prod and \ref elem_div respectively. 
If the arguments to these operations are not conformable for the appropriate
type and operation, the application will exit with an error message.

These operations have been overloaded for appropriate combinations of
constant and variable objects. 
The overloaded versions with variable
types are optimized for efficient derivative computation. 
Only the constant types are currently documented here.

typically optimized for automatic differentiation and automatically
invoke custom adjoint code.

/**
  \defgroup RA Cautions for functions that return variable objects.
  These functions must be called in any function that returns
  a "variable" object, ie dvariable, dvar_vector, ... Failure to so
  may generate an error message related to an overflow in the 
  RETURN_ARRAYS stack, or even worse cause derivatives to be incorrect.
