#ADMB Project 
*ADMB-11.1*  
*Released May 10, 2013*  

Describe ADMB build and installation procedures for Windows and MinGW.

---

_For Windows computers with Visual C++ compiler already installed, 
read and follow the instuctions in [QuickStart for Visual C++](QuickStartVisualC++.html)._

_For builds within *Cygwin* and *MinGW-Msys* shells, read and follow the
instructions in the [QuickStart for Unix](QuickStartUnix.html)._

Prerequisites
-------------
  
The following should be installed on the local computer.  

* Subversion Client   
  _Note: SlikSVN is a command line Subversion Client._ 

Quick Start Windows
-------------------

1. Open **Command Prompt** window  
       _Note: 32 or 64 bit Command Prompt (Command.com) is required._

2. **Download** ADMB

       There are **two ways** to get the source distribution.

       **From Version Control**  
       To get the most current code, download from directly from 
       ADMB version control using the command below.

        C:\> svn checkout http://www.admb-project.org/svn/trunk admb

       This will download admb trunk folder to _C:\admb\ _.

       **From Zip**  
       If **unable** to checkout code, download the
       [full source distribution](http://www.admb-project.org/buildbot/snapshots/admb-latest-src.zip).

       Double click downloaded zip file and extract to _C:\admb\ _.

3. Change to admb directory

        C:\> cd admb

4. Install C++ compiler

       If C++ compiler (ie MinGW, Cygwin and Rtools) has already been installed and is in the System Enviroment PATH, skip this step and go to
   step 5.

       If C++ compiler has not been installed, use the command below to download
   and install the MinGW C++ Compiler to the _C:\admb\utilities\mingw_ folder.

        C:\admb\> utilities\get-mingw.bat

       Downloads from MinGW website, then installs to the local computer.  This will also update existing MinGW installation.

5. **Build** ADMB

       If MinGW was installed with _get-mingw.bat_, use the command below.

        C:\admb\> utilities\make

       If debug symbols are needed, use the command below.

        C:\admb\> utilities\make debug

       If MinGW-Msys was installed and is included in System Enviroment PATH, use the command below.

        C:\admb\> make

       _Note: For Rtools build, use utilities\make.exe instead of the included make in Rtools._

6. **Use** ADMB
 
       The following commands build and run the simple example.

        C:\admb\> cd examples\admb\simple
        C:\admb\examples\admb\simple\> C:\admb\admb simple.tpl
        C:\admb\examples\admb\simple\> simple.exe

7. **[OPTIONAL]** Include admb script in System Enviroment **PATH**

       Avoids the need the to include path with the admb script.

       1. In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Enviroment Variables** button.

       2. In the **Enviroment Variables** window, click on the **New** button, then in the **Variable name** input type `PATH` and in the **Variable value** input type `C:\admb\;%PATH%`.

       3. Click the **OK** button when done and open a new command prompt.  

            C:\admb\> cd examples\admb\simple
            C:\admb\examples\admb\simple\> admb simple.tpl
            C:\admb\examples\admb\simple\> simple.exe
